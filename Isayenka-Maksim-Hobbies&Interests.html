                        Programming has been an interest of mine for a very long time. My journey with programming <br>
                        started at 8 years old with <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/" target = "_blank"> Scratch.</a> Scratch taught 
                         me all the basics of programming and helped <br> me advance into harder languages like <a href = "https://www.python.org/" target = "_blank"> Python</a>, C, and Java. I use many IDE's
                        but by far my favourite<br> one is <a href = "https://code.visualstudio.com/" target = "_blank"> Visual Studio Code</a> because
                        its really easy to use.

                            Hockey is one of my favourite sports that I've been playing for a really long time. I've been playing <br>
                            for the <a href = "https://egmha.com/" target = "_blank"> East Gwillimbury Eagles</a> since I was 8 as a defenceman.
                            I have always been a <a href = "https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs" target = "_blank"> Leafs</a> fan and my <br> 
                            favourite player is <a href = "https://www.nhl.com/player/auston-matthews-8479318" target = "_blank"> Auston Matthews</a> because he scores a lot of goals.

                            Piano has been my main hobby ever since I was a little child. I wanted to play piano as soon as my father <br>
                            introduced me to classical music. I started playing at the age of 5 and have loved it ever since. My first <br>
                            piano was <a href = "https://www.casio-music.com/euro/digitalpianos/grandhybrid/gp-510/" target = "_blank"> GP-510 </a> casio piano.
                            My favourite piece ever is <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._11_(Mozart)" target = "_blank"> Ronda Alla Turca</a> and my <br>
                            favourite player is <a href = "https://www.langlangofficial.com/" target = "_blank"> Lang Lang</a>
